# WynnMap
The map of Wynncraft
This map is created with the <a href="https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/journeymap">JourneyMap Mod</a>.
The DIM0 folder is the data which is located at %appdata%\.minecraft\journeymap\data\mp\Wynncraft\.
We only use the night and day data and not the cave map.
In MapRaw you can see the files that are created when you save the map using journeymap.
In MapEdited you can see the files that were created by removing all the unnecessary stuff from the file from MapRaw.
In MapPotato you can see a map where all the mystery potatoes we found are indicated by a purple dod and where the direction they were facing is indicated by the purple line.
