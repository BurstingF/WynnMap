# WynnMap
The map of Wynncraft <br>
This map is created with the <a href="https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/journeymap">JourneyMap Mod</a>. <br>
The DIM0 folder is the data which is located at \.minecraft\journeymap\data\mp\Wynncraft\. <br>
We only use the night and day data and not the cave map. <br>
In MapRaw you can see the files that are created when you save the map using journeymap. <br>
In MapEdited you can see the files that were created by removing all the unnecessary stuff from the file from MapRaw. <br>
In MapPotato you can see a map where all the mystery potatoes we found are indicated by a purple dod and where the direction they were facing is indicated by the purple line. <br>
